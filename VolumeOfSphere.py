print("Question: Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.\n")
print("Solution")
print("Given diameter of the sphere is = 12 cm ")
print("So radius of the sphere is = 6 cm ")
r=6.0
print("Value of the constant PI is = 3.14 ")
pi=3.14
V= 4.0/3.0*pi* r**3
print("Hence the volume of the sphere is: ",V)
